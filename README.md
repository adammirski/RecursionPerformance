## Features

- **Factorial Calculation**: Computes the factorial of a given number.
- **Fibonacci Sequence**: Generates the nth Fibonacci number.
- **Greatest Common Divisor**: Finds the GCD of two numbers.
- **List Summation**: Calculates the sum of all elements in a list.
- **Palindrome Check**: Determines if a given string is a palindrome.
- **Power Calculation**: Raises a base number to a specified exponent.
- **Binary Search**: Searches for a target value within a sorted list.

## Installation

To run this script, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/recursion-functions.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd recursion-functions
   ```

3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python recursion.py
   ```

## Usage

You can use this script to perform a variety of recursive calculations. The script is designed to be easy to use and modify for different purposes. To use a specific function, simply call it with the appropriate arguments as shown in the examples below.

## Function Descriptions

### `factorial(n)`

Calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer `n`.

### `fibonacci(n)`

Generates the nth Fibonacci number, where `n` is a non-negative integer.

### `gcd(a, b)`

Finds the greatest common divisor of two integers `a` and `b`.

### `sum_of_list(lst)`

Calculates the sum of all elements in the list `lst`.

### `is_palindrome(s)`

Checks whether the string `s` is a palindrome.

### `power(base, exp)`

Calculates the result of raising `base` to the power of `exp`.

### `binary_search(arr, target, low, high)`

Performs a binary search to find the `target` in the sorted list `arr` within the indices `low` and `high`.

## Examples

Here's how you can use the functions in the script:

```python
from recursion import factorial, fibonacci, gcd, sum_of_list, is_palindrome, power, binary_search

# Calculate the factorial of 5
print(f"Factorial of 5: {factorial(5)}")  # Output: 120

# Calculate the 5th Fibonacci number
print(f"Fibonacci of 5: {fibonacci(5)}")  # Output: 5

# Calculate the GCD of 48 and 18
print(f"GCD of 48 and 18: {gcd(48, 18)}")  # Output: 6

# Calculate the sum of the list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(f"Sum of list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]: {sum_of_list([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])}")  # Output: 15

# Check if 'radar' is a palindrome
print(f"Is 'radar' a palindrome? {is_palindrome('radar')}")  # Output: True

# Calculate 2 raised to the power of 3
print(f"2 to the power of 3: {power(2, 3)}")  # Output: 8

# Perform a binary search for 3 in the sorted list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(f"Binary search for 3 in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]: {binary_search([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 3, 0, 4)}")  # Output: 2
```
